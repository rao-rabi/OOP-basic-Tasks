Problem 1: Class and ObjectCreate a C++ class called Rectangle with attributes length and width. Implement member functions to set and get the dimensions of the rectangle, calculate its area, and calculate its perimeter. Then, create two objects of the Rectangle class and print their areas and perimeters.

Problem 2: InheritanceCreate a base class called Shape with a pure virtual function area(). Then, create two derived classes, Circle and Rectangle, that inherit from Shape. Implement the area() function in each derived class to calculate the area of the respective shape.

Problem 3: PolymorphismUsing the Shape, Circle, and Rectangle classes from Problem 2, create an array of pointers to Shape objects that includes both Circle and Rectangle objects. Use polymorphism to calculate and print the areas of all the shapes in the array.

Problem 4: Operator OverloadingOverload the + operator for the Rectangle class so that you can add two rectangles together to create a new rectangle with dimensions equal to the sum of the dimensions of the two rectangles. Test the operator overloading by adding two rectangles.

Problem 5: Encapsulation Create a C++ class called BankAccount with private attributes for accountNumber, balance, and accountHolderName. Implement member functions to deposit, withdraw, and display the balance. Ensure that the withdraw function does not allow withdrawing more money than the current balance.

Problem 6: Abstract Class and Interface Create an abstract base class called Vehicle with pure virtual functions for start() and stop(). Then, create two classes, Car and Motorcycle, that inherit from Vehicle and implement the start() and stop() functions differently for each vehicle type.

Problem 7: Static Members Create a C++ class called Student with attributes name and rollNumber. Implement a static member variable totalStudents to keep track of the total number of students created. Initialize totalStudents to 0 and increment it in the constructor. Test this by creating several Student objects and printing the total number of students.
